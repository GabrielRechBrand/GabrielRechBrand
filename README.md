### Ahoy! I'm Gabriel.

I am a Back-end Developer at VHL Sistemas and a Computer Science student at the University of Southern Santa Carina. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to learn and grow as a developer. In my free time, I like to work on personal coding projects, learn new technologies, and contribute to open-source projects.
